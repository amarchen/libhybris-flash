libhybris-flash
===============

Testing Sailfish flash control via libhybris

Getting started
---------------

When building without a real libhybris compiled for your device, run init.sh. It will fetch sources from git. You'll have headers at least. Then check .pro file to see if these downloaded headers are included or ones from your real platform build.
